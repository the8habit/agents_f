       "**Bridge Knowledge Silos**: Ecologists understand natural cycles but may lack economic implementation tools. Economists create policy but often without ecological understanding. Technologists create powerful tools but may miss cultural contexts. Anthropologists understand cultural systems but may lack implementation mechanisms.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Create New Methodologies**: By combining ecological modeling with economic frameworks and digital technology, we could design data-driven systems that monitor and adapt in real-time while respecting cultural contexts.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Practical Applications**:\n",
       "- Design urban food systems that sequester carbon, build soil, and create circular economies\n",
       "- Develop economic indicators that measure regenerative capacity, not just growth\n",
       "- Create technology platforms that enable collaborative resource management across stakeholder groups\n",
       "- Design policy frameworks that align economic incentives with ecological restoration\n",
       "\n",
       "This field would train practitioners to think across boundaries, combining the rigor of science with the systems thinking of ecology, the practical tools of economics, the scaling power of technology, and the contextual wisdom of anthropology."
